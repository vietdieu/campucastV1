## 🎯 Strategic Organizational Metrics
We continuously measure our performance across the following research-driven KPIs:
1. **Decision Quality**: % of product adjustments directly backed by high-confidence evidence from our Observation Layer.
2. **Learning Velocity**: The average calendar days to go from Research Question (ERC) to a validated product parameter update.
3. **Decision Accuracy**: % of shipped snapshots that successfully achieve their estimated Product KPI targets.

## ⚖️ Evidence Budget Rule
- **Framework Growth ≤ Evidence Growth**: We promise to freeze meta-work and avoid growing structural complexity faster than our capacity to collect actionable, user-centric evidence.
