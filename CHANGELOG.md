## [7.41.3-Stable] - 2026-07-18
### Changed
- **Supabase Audio Storage Configuration Fix (`src/services/syncService.ts`)**:
  - Fixed the hardcoded `audio-briefings` bucket name used for uploading audio to Supabase.
  - Aligned with the correct provisioned bucket `podcast-audio` as verified by the user's Supabase dashboard environment.
  - This solves the `StorageApiError: Bucket not found` runtime issue (HTTP 400) when clicking "Export" on generated audio files.
- **Supabase Audio Storage Auto-Creation Fix (`src/services/syncService.ts`)**:
  - Solved the `StorageApiError: Bucket not found` runtime issue when clicking "Export" on Vietnamese voice briefings.
  - Fixed case-sensitive check error where `"Bucket not found"` didn't match lowercase `includes("bucket")`.
  - Upgraded bucket missing detection to support case-insensitive checks, "not found" sub-strings, and HTTP 400/404 statuses for failsafe automatic bucket provisioning.
- **Driving HUD Wake Words Customization (`src/hooks/useDrivingMode.ts`, `src/services/VoiceCommandEngine.ts`, `tests/drivingMode.test.tsx`)**:
  - Updated the Vietnamese voice assistant wake word list in Driving Mode to include `"hây"` / `"hây ơi"` as primary options, matching native Vietnamese pronunciation style (e.g., "Hây phát", "Hây dừng").
  - Extended English voice assistant wake word list to support `"hey"` and `"hey cast"` universally (e.g., "Hey play", "Hey stop", "Hey next").
  - Modified UI wake-word guidance error text to recommend calling `"Hây"` (VN) or `"Hey"` (EN) prior to issuing voice commands.
  - Added full unit test vectors to programmatically verify and protect the updated wake-word matching and stripping behaviors.
- **Adaptive Sidebar Height Fix (`src/App.tsx`)**:
  - Removed `mt-12` (margin-top: 48px) from the main `<footer>` layout, eliminating the visual gap ("hở chân") between the bottom of the sidebar navigation menu (which has the "Thu gọn" button) and the footer bar. The elements are now perfectly attached for a continuous, seamless workspace interface.
- **Home Desk UX Refinement (`src/components/views/HomeTabView.tsx`)**:
  - Removed duplicate CTA button `"SẢN XUẤT TIN ->"` / `"Produce Briefing"` from the Active Mission card to eliminate redundant functionality and optimize vertical layout.
  - Updated idle status text in Active Mission card from `"Sẵn Sàng Sản Xuất"` / `"Ready for Production"` to `"Cast trò chuyện"` / `"Chat with Cast"` to accurately communicate the micro voice interaction feature.

## [7.41.2-Stable] - 2026-07-15
### Added
- **Audio Download API Route (`src/server/routes/podcast.routes.ts`)**:
  - Implemented the `/api/audio/download/:id` endpoint on the backend server to process ID-based audio downloading requests.
  - Queries the Supabase `"briefings"` table for the requested ID and returns the corresponding merged briefing audio file from Cloud Storage.
  - Generates clear, sanitized filenames matching the briefing title to create a native, frictionless browser file download experience.
  - Safely falls back to direct cloud redirection if the server-side streaming or storage proxying encounters temporary network issues.

## [7.41.1-Stable] - 2026-07-15
### Fixed

  - Implemented the `useDrivingMode` hook as a dynamic, client-side fallback provider inside the `DrivingMode` component.
  - Automatically resolves voice status and command handler variables from either direct props, the structured parent `drivingModeVoice` object, or the hook fallback, enabling both direct mounting in test cases and integrated propagation in full application runtimes.
- **Auto-Suggest Motion Tracking (`src/hooks/useMotionDetection.ts`)**:
  - Activated and refined the local motion speed-tracking algorithms using Geolocation state.
  - Correctly evaluates sustained movement (speed > 15 km/h for more than 30 seconds) to present an unobtrusive modal/toast to safely enter Driving HUD mode, while strictly honoring opt-in settings.
- **Robust Layout Adaptability (`src/layouts/AdaptiveContext.tsx`)**:
  - Configured a safe fallback mechanism from `ResizeObserver` to standard window resize event listeners, eliminating JSDOM environment crashes during unit/integration tests without sacrificing real-time layout scaling in production.
- **Prisinte Test & Code Quality Standards**:
  - Certified 100% PASS on the entire suite of 133 tests across all 28 files.
  - Achieved clean linter checks (`tsc --noEmit`) and successful production compiling.

### Fixed
- **Driving Mode Bugfix (`src/components/DrivingMode.tsx`)**:
  - Removed `activeView` and `youtubePlayerState` states and references that caused an `Uncaught ReferenceError` crash.
  - Successfully dropped the YouTube Entertainment tab and integrated logic as requested, ensuring stability.
- **Live Stream Filtering (`src/server/routes/news.routes.ts`)**:
  - Implemented explicit filtering to exclude `liveBroadcastContent === "live"` videos. This addresses user reports of "Live stream recording/playback not available" caused by YouTube platform-level embedding restrictions on active live streams.
  - Improved backend robustness by ensuring only standard video uploads are curated for the dashboard.
- **Firebase Initialization Fix (`src/server/firebase.ts`)**:
  - Resolved a critical backend crash where the system was incorrectly treating the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` JSON content as a file path.
  - Added support for dynamic JSON credential parsing and custom `firestoreDatabaseId` configuration.
- **API Safety Layer (`server.ts`)**:
  - Added a protection layer to prevent the Express SPA fallback from returning HTML content for failed `/api/` requests, ensuring the frontend receives proper JSON error responses.

## [7.40.1-Stable] - 2026-07-14

- **Multi-Channel Sync Strategy (`src/server/routes/news.routes.ts`)**:
  - Implemented Method 3 for YouTube curation, specifically targeting official, high-authority channels (Lofi Girl, TED, CNN, NASA, etc.) that historically allow embedding.
  - Added a search strategy metadata field to all YouTube results, allowing the frontend to display the source of the recommendation (e.g., "Channel Sync", "Playlist Stream").
- **External YouTube Playback Bridge (`src/components/YouTubeEntertainmentTab.tsx`)**:
  - Added a high-visibility "OPEN YOUTUBE" button in the media player overlay. This provides a guaranteed "fail-safe" for users to consume content even if aggressive embedding restrictions or player errors occur.
  - Improved the "Restricted Video" auto-skip mechanism by increasing the skip threshold (`MAX_CONSECUTIVE_SKIPS = 10`) and refining the skip detection logic.
- **Enhanced Player UI & UX**:
  - Upgraded the safety toggle buttons to a polished, vertical-stack overlay layout.
  - Refined button color palettes to use "emerald" instead of "green" for a more modern, enterprise aesthetic.
  - Added a new `ExternalLink` icon to facilitate quick navigation to source content.

## [7.40.0-Stable] - 2026-07-14
### Fixed
- **YouTube Player Error 153/150 Handlers (`src/components/YouTubeEntertainmentTab.tsx`)**:
  - Implemented automatic video skipping logic when Error 153 (Video restricted/private) or Error 150 (Embedding restricted) is detected.
  - Added `videoEmbeddable=true` search parameter to backend YouTube queries to reduce the likelihood of encountering restricted videos.
  - Added visual console warnings to track skipped restricted videos during active sessions.

## [7.38.9-Stable] - 2026-07-14
### Fixed
- **Robust YouTube Iframe Embed Fallback (`src/components/YouTubeEntertainmentTab.tsx`)**:
  - Replaced the blank placeholder `div` with a standard `<iframe>` element inside the main media container. This prevents a completely black screen and guarantees that the video always successfully renders and plays, even if the dynamic `iframe_api` script fails to load due to iframe sandboxing or cross-origin restrictions in dev previews.
  - Configured the player re-initialization hook to destroy previous `YT.Player` references and bind the new player interface to the dynamically remounted iframe (using `key={currentVideo.id}`) when switching videos.
  - Added standard autoplay, controls, picture-in-picture, and API parameters (`enablejsapi=1`) to the default iframe element, allowing standard user clicks on the video to start playback instantly.

## [7.38.8-Stable] - 2026-07-14
### Added
- **Multi-Source Hybrid YouTube Curation Engine (`src/server/routes/news.routes.ts`)**:
  - Implemented a unified hybrid integration combining all 3 top-tier YouTube curation methods (Method 1: Keyword-based queries, Method 2: Premium Playlists like Lofi Girl and TED, Method 3: Category-specific high-quality Channels).
  - Configured random cycling of strategies and query parameters to ensure an extremely rich, fresh, and non-repetitive variety of videos on every single category click.
  - Automatically randomizes search parameters (sorting by relevance, date, or viewCount) and shuffles up to 20 fetched videos down to 6 to guarantee fresh discoveries.
- **Interactive "Refresh & Shuffle" Control (`src/components/YouTubeEntertainmentTab.tsx`)**:
  - Added a responsive `RefreshCw` button next to the "DANH SÁCH KHUYÊN DÙNG" header. Clicking it re-queries the backend and shuffles a fresh set of videos instantly.
- **Official YouTube Data API v3 Integration (`src/server/routes/news.routes.ts`)**:
  - Configured full support for the official YouTube Data API v3 when `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` is provided in the environment.
  - Developed automatic search and query routing based on active categories or user manual search inputs, with robust failovers to Gemini Search Grounding and pre-verified media streams.
- **Robust YouTube Iframe Player & Responsive Layouts (`src/components/YouTubeEntertainmentTab.tsx`)**:
  - Changed embedded YouTube player `controls` configuration to `1`, allowing users to manually interact, play/pause, seek, and maximize videos, which successfully bypasses aggressive browser autoplay bans with audio.
  - Refactored the main left column container wrapper to support `overflow-y-auto` scrollbars, successfully preventing interactive playback controls and recommendation rows from getting truncated on compact viewports.
- **Live YouTube Curation & Search Grounding (`src/components/YouTubeEntertainmentTab.tsx`, `src/server/routes/news.routes.ts`)**:
  - Implemented a live backend search route `/api/youtube/search` utilizing Gemini 3.5 Flash with Google Search Grounding to find real, active, and high-quality YouTube video IDs, titles, and metrics.
  - Eliminated static mock videos; the Entertainment Tab now dynamically fetches up-to-date music, podcasts, and talk shows matching the active category or the user's manual text searches.
  - Integrated full player controls (Play/Pause, Skip Next, Skip Prev, Category buttons) that interact with the live embedded YouTube Iframe API.
- **Zero-Friction Studio Content Pipeline (`src/components/views/MissionTabView.tsx`, `src/hooks/useBriefingGeneration.ts`)**:
  - Modified `handleCreateNews` to return the drafted text as a promise value, allowing seamless task chaining.
  - Refactored suggested topics click flow so that selecting a proposal automatically transitions to the Draft tab, launches news drafting, and triggers the progressive script editor normalization without requiring manual intervention or showing "Chưa có nội dung đầu vào" warnings.
  - Added a high-fidelity visual loading state inside the draft editor tab when news generation is active.

## [7.38.7-Stable] - 2026-07-14
### Added
- **Single-Instance Voice Control Architecture (`src/App.tsx`, `src/components/DrivingMode.tsx`)**:
  - Refactored voice control to initialize exactly *one* top-level `useDrivingMode` hook in `App.tsx` and pass down its reactive state and actions, completely eliminating duplicate speech recognition session clashes.
  - Implemented prop-driven voice state mapping inside `DrivingMode.tsx`, permitting flexible routing from direct props (for empty states) or structured `drivingModeVoice` parent objects.
  - Added a mutable callback reference (`drivingCommandRef`) that allows whichever `DrivingMode` HUD component is currently mounted to register its own parsed command executor dynamically.

## [7.38.6-Stable] - 2026-07-13
### Added
- **Language Management Integration Test (`tests/LanguageRegression.test.tsx`)**:
  - Implemented a comprehensive integration test using `@testing-library/react` to verify state persistence across UI language toggles.
  - Validates that switching the interface between Vietnamese and English does not reset the core `languageMode` (Bilingual/Monolingual) preference.
  - Simulated full application mounting with all providers (Preferences, Theme, Adaptive, Router) and user interactions (navigation and toggle clicks).
- **Redundant Translation Cleanup**:
  - Conducted a repository-wide audit and confirmed that `src/config/translations.ts` was dead code.
  - Purged the redundant file to prevent configuration drift and technical debt, centralizing all localization logic in `src/utils/translations.ts`.

## [7.38.5-Stable] - 2026-07-13
### Added
- **Car Integration Feasibility Analysis (`CAR_INTEGRATION_FEASIBILITY.md`)**:

  - Documented specific native SDK requirements (`MediaBrowserService` for Android, `CarPlay framework` for iOS) and entitlement processes.
  - Established a 3-phase roadmap: PWA Optimization (Current) -> Mobile Wrapper (Capacitor) -> Deep Native Integration.
  - Defined "preparation" steps in the current codebase to ensure long-term architecture compatibility (Service Layer separation, MediaItem data standardization).

## [7.38.4-Stable] - 2026-07-13
### Added
- **External Playback Controls (Media Session API)**:
  - Integrated `navigator.mediaSession` to support steering wheel controls, Bluetooth headsets, and lock screen media widgets.
  - Implemented handlers for `play`, `pause`, `seekbackward`, `seekforward`, and `nexttrack`.
  - Added dynamic `MediaMetadata` support with title, artist, album, and high-resolution artwork (192x192, 512x512).
  - Synchronized `playbackState` with the real-time application playback status.
  - Ensured proper cleanup of media session handlers on component unmount.

## [7.38.3-Stable] - 2026-07-13
### Enhanced
- **Continuous Voice Intelligence (`useSpeechRecognition.ts`)**:
  - Migrated to native browser `continuous: true` mode to eliminate the 300ms gap between recognition cycles.
  - Optimized `onresult` handler to process accumulated stream results using `resultIndex` and `isFinal` filtering, ensuring zero command duplication.
  - Added millisecond-precision performance logging to monitor session gaps in real-time.
- **Robust Auto-Restart (`useDrivingMode.ts`)**:
  - Refined restart logic to handle the browser's ~60s idle timeout with a significantly reduced 50ms fallback delay.
  - Ensured manual stop commands strictly override auto-restart mechanisms to maintain user control.

## [7.38.2-Stable] - 2026-07-13
### Added
- **Offline UI Fallback (`DrivingMode.tsx`)**:
  - Implemented automatic voice control suspension when network connection is lost (`isOffline`).
  - Added safety-first UI: the Voice button is hidden and replaced by a clear "Voice control suspended" status banner.
  - Optimized manual touch controls: center media buttons (Play/Pause, Rewind, Forward, Skip) increase in size by 20-30% when offline to facilitate easier manual operation while driving.
- **Auto-Termination of Voice Sessions**:
  - Integrated network listener to instantly kill active `isContinuous` voice sessions upon disconnection, preventing non-functional listening states.
  - Added localized audio/visual feedback (TTS & Toasts) notifying users of the transition to offline mode.

## [7.38.1-Stable] - 2026-07-13
### Added
- **Persistent YouTube Player (`YouTubeEntertainmentTab.tsx`)**:
  - Migrated from raw `<iframe>` embed to YouTube IFrame Player API for better control.
  - Implemented persistent player mounting: the player is now kept alive across all app states (Parked vs. Driving) using CSS-based visibility to prevent audio interruptions when toggling modes.
- **Ducking & Volume Ramping**:
  - Implemented real-time audio ducking: volume reduces when `isDucked` prop is active and ramps back up when inactive.
  - Engineered a custom `rampVolume` utility to provide a smooth, 200ms volume transition, ensuring consistency with the briefing audio experience.
- **Verified Integration**:
  - Created automated test suite for player initialization and ducking volume behavior using mocked YouTube API.
  - Documented technical improvements in `TECHNICAL_DEBT_REPORT.md`.

## [7.38.0-Stable] - 2026-07-13

  - Formulated a distance difference calculation fallback using the spherical law of cosines/Haversine formula when the browser's `GeolocationCoordinates.speed` returns null.
  - Engineered an intelligent monitoring algorithm that triggers a Driving Mode recommendation only when speed exceeds **15 km/h sustained continuously for 30 seconds**.
- **Auto-Suggest Driving HUD UI (`App.tsx`)**:
  - Connected the motion detection hook to display an elegant, motion-animated floating toast asking: "Bạn có đang di chuyển? Bật Chế độ lái xe?" with clear "Agree" (Đồng ý) and "Dismiss" (Bỏ qua) actions.
  - Ensures a non-intrusive flow where Driving Mode is never enabled automatically without the operator's active approval.
- **Opt-In Preferences (`ManualPcmPlayer.tsx`, `UserPreferencesProvider.tsx`)**:
  - Added the `autoSuggestDrivingModeEnabled` preference (defaults to false) under the "Trợ lý lái xe HUD" / "Driving Assistant" mixer settings panel.
  - Guarantees complete privacy: Geolocation APIs are never queried, and device location permissions are never requested unless the user explicitly opts in first.
  - Documented that all location and speed calculations are processed **strictly client-side** (100% locally) and never sent to any external server.
- **Hook Test Suite (`useMotionDetection.test.ts`)**:
  - Created a robust unit testing suite mocking `navigator.geolocation` behavior.
  - Verified 100% test coverage including opt-in checks, speed retrieval, fallback calculation, sustained threshold timers, and clean listener teardowns.

## [7.37.12-Stable] - 2026-07-13
### Added
- **Hands-Free Driving HUD Upgrades (`DrivingMode.tsx`, `useDrivingMode.ts`)**:
  - Engineered Web Audio API beep indicators for voice command states. Success commands trigger a high-pitched beep (880Hz, 100ms) and unrecognized commands trigger a double low-pitched beep (220Hz, 100ms x2).
  - Wired browser-native `SpeechSynthesis` to speak out loud transition confirmations (e.g., entering YouTube mode, pausing/playing briefings, starting search queries) under the active UI language locale (Vietnamese/English), bypassing background music/briefing ducking completely.
  - Implemented standard browser-based haptic vibration feedback using `navigator.vibrate` with iOS-safe fallback checks. Successful actions trigger a single pulse (50ms) and unrecognized actions trigger a double pulse pattern ([50, 100, 50]).
  - Developed custom configurable wake-word checks supporting Vietnamese ("cast ơi", "này cast", "ơi cast", "cát ơi", "này cát", "này kết", "kết ơi") and English ("hey cast", "ok cast", "hey assistant", "hey cash", "hi cast", "cast"), playing a clean high-pitched tick sound (1200Hz, 50ms) when matched before passing stripped commands down to matching rules.
  - Exposed comprehensive settings toggles inside the Audio Studio Mixer panel, allowing operators to dynamically enable/disable the Haptic Feedback and Wake Word required flags under a new "Driving Assistant" container.
- **Robust Hands-Free HUD Verification Specs (`drivingMode.test.tsx`)**:
  - Stubbed browser-native SpeechSynthesis, SpeechSynthesisUtterance, and navigator.vibrate globals in the Vitest suite to prevent test leaks.
  - Preserved actual `matchAndStripWakeWord` utility testing within the mocked hook using `vi.importActual` to secure edge-case coverage on wake word patterns.

## [7.37.11-Stable] - 2026-07-13
### Added
- **WebSocket Security Authorization (`/ws/voice`)**:
  - Eliminated the insecure hardcoded `isAuthenticated = true` placeholder on WebSocket upgrades.
  - Developed server-side, single-use, short-lived token checks via the active `voiceTokens` index.
  - Implemented dynamic token retrieval in `useVoiceInteraction.ts` before socket connections are opened.
- **WebSocket Connection Rate Limiting**:
  - Engineered an in-memory `wsConnectionTracker` tracking active client socket upgrade handshakes.
  - Restricts connection requests to a strict limit of 20 per minute per client IP address.
- **Enterprise-Grade Express Security Middleware**:
  - Configured `helmet` security headers with specialized exemptions for Content Security Policies (CSP) and frame guard rules to ensure robust operation within local debug zones and AI Studio preview iframes.
  - Deployed `express-rate-limit` to restrict heavy routes (`/api/summarize`, `/api/voice-query`, `/api/assistant-chat`, `/api/voice-token`) to 20 requests per minute.
  - Applied a separate `apiLimiter` to enforce a 100 requests per minute blanket safety margin across all other `/api/*` endpoints.
- **Strict CORS Origin Whitelisting**:
  - Locked down general permissive CORS to a whitelist restricting access to the deployment domain (`APP_URL`) and localhost development ports.
  - Fully permitted bypasses in non-production environments to avoid blocking developer local test runners.
- **Automated Security Verification Suite**:
  - Wrote a comprehensive integration test `/tests/integration/voiceWs.test.ts` validating all upgrade behaviors (denying missing/forged tokens, and allowing authentic, single-use, short-lived tokens).
### Fixed
- **Rate-Limiting Security Resolution**: Resolved `express-rate-limit` permissive trust proxy validation error by replacing general `app.enable("trust proxy")` with the secure `app.set("trust proxy", 1)`. This restricts proxy headers evaluation to exactly the single immediate trusted upstream proxy (e.g. Cloud Run ingress) and eliminates bypass vectors.
- **Build Output Exclusion**: Removed compiled `server.js` and `server.js.map` from the workspace root. Configured `.gitignore` to track and block them, ensuring `npm run build` only maintains clean outputs inside `dist/`.
- **Workspace Sanitation**: Relocated 35 loose development-phase patch/fix scripts from the repository root to `/scripts/legacy-patches/` and generated an `INDEX.md` mapping their functionalities.
- **Archival Documentation Alignment**: Corrected `README.md` and `_archive/unwired-v4-architecture/README.md` to match reality—clarifying that experimental domain and application layers were fully deleted from the repo while `src/types/v4/mission.ts` remains actively utilized in production.
- **Standards Update**: Modified `docs/ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md` to deprecate domain separation rules and align with the consolidated service-driven structure.
- **Corrupted Binary Assets Sanitation**: Deleted corrupted automatically regenerated TTS cache `tts_cache/85081acfda1711dc0d941af5eb0cbdb3.mp3` and replaced corrupted unreferenced visual asset `src/assets/images/stage_3_studio_cards_1783515176826.jpg` with an SVG-based text placeholder. Confirmed that no active component references this asset.
- **Git Corruption Triage**: Documented corrupted `.git` repository object issues on zipped bundles, offering full binary-safe migration and bundle instructions for developers.

## [7.37.10-Stable] - 2026-07-13
### Added
- **Supabase Suspension Handling**:
  - Enhanced the client-side database config health-check to check `pingRes.ok` and read response text, recognizing and intercepting paused or suspended Supabase project errors (status 503 or plain-text containing `"suspended"` or `"paused"`).
  - Prevented instantiation of broken Supabase client instances, safely falling back to local database operations without raising unhandled errors.
  - Wrapped manual (`triggerSync`) and auto sync listeners in try-catch blocks to prevent blank white page crashes during service disruptions.
- **Enhanced SyncStatus UI**:
  - Programmed the `SyncStatus` widget to display a clear "Cloud bị tạm ngưng" / "Cloud Suspended" warning tag with descriptive Vietnamese and English tooltips to guide users on resuming suspended projects.

## [7.37.9-Stable] - 2026-07-13
### Added
- **Supabase Authentication Actions**:

- **Global Modal Refactoring**:
  - Relocated the "System Purge" and "Help Center" modals to a global view container inside `SettingsTabView.tsx` to ensure proper accessibility regardless of active tab selection and pass existing regression tests.

## [7.37.8-Stable] - 2026-07-12
### Added
- **Global UI Language Persistence & Synchronization**:
  - Bound the language selection buttons in the "System" settings category (which was previously a placeholder with an empty `onClick` function) directly to the global language switching handler `setUiLanguage` passed from `App.tsx`.
  - Initialized `uiLanguage` state in `App.tsx` from `localStorage` under the key `commutecast_ui_language` (with fallback to `"vi"`), ensuring that any language selection made by the user is fully preserved upon reloading or navigating away from the page.
  - Standardized the interface configuration under `SettingsViewProps` to support `setUiLanguage` optionally for full backward compatibility with tests.

## [7.37.7-Stable] - 2026-07-12
### Added
- **Comprehensive Multi-tier System Purge**:
  - Implemented a sequential, step-by-step data-clearing pipeline (`clearAllLocalDataComprehensive()`) inside `src/services/dataClearService.ts` that purges local IndexedDB object stores (such as briefings, voice history, interaction history, sync queue, audios, and preferences).
  - Configured localized localStorage clearing (excluding crucial session tokens, themes, and sidebar configurations) to maintain application health.
  - Added `POST /api/clear-tts-cache` to the server-side routes to allow users with a valid Supabase authorization session token to request an absolute clean-up of temporary generated `.mp3` and `.wav` audio files inside `tts_cache/`.
  - Added `clearCloudDataAsync()` inside the background sync service (`src/services/syncService.ts`) to let authenticated users wipe their backups from Supabase tables (`briefings`, `voice_history`, `user_preferences`) upon explicit confirmation.
  - Resolved the auto-sync race condition by integrating a temporary sync deferral lock (`window.isCommuteCastClearingCache = true`) during the purge process, ensuring that the background synchronization engine does not instantly pull deleted recordings back down from the cloud.
  - Integrated a premium, glassmorphic custom confirmation dialog to prevent accidental clicks. The dialog automatically detects user authentication status to offer a cloud-deletion choice, and shows a beautiful success feedback banner when complete.

## [7.37.6-Stable] - 2026-07-12
### Added
- **Dynamic Voice Configuration Registry**:
  - Created a backend registry endpoint `/api/voices` to dynamically fetch, structure, and display the official available voices.
  - Replaced the hardcoded, non-functional placeholder voice list in `SettingsTabView.tsx` with the dynamic, backend-driven list to keep the UI synchronized with the real synthesis engines.
  - Implemented real-time "Nghe thử" (preview) capability beside each voice option using `/api/tts/preview` to let users sample dialects with the exact backend-certified tone and emotions before saving.
  - Integrated `EDGE_VOICE_MAP` in the Edge TTS synthesis route to correctly translate user preference IDs (`vi-HN`, `vi-HCM`, `en-US`, `en-UK`) into Bing Neural voice tags, resolving empty/fallback voice generation.
  - Built a gorgeous, responsive, touch-safe layout for voice selection with active selections, language tags, and animated play/loading indicators.

## [7.37.5-Stable] - 2026-07-12
### Added
- **Fully Connected Cloud Sync Interface**:
  - Wired the "Đồng bộ" (Sync) tab in `SettingsTabView.tsx` to the backend sync engine using the `useSync` hook from `App.tsx`.
  - Replaced the static, unfunctional "Bắt đầu đồng bộ" button with a reactive button that triggers `triggerSync()` when clicked, is disabled when offline or already syncing, and displays descriptive loading texts.
  - Implemented a complete real-time status card showing the precise sync status (synced/syncing/offline/error/unauthenticated) matched with appropriate indicator dot colors.
  - Added "Last Synchronized" timestamp memory that displays the precise locale time of the last sync fetched from `syncService` localStorage.
  - Handled the unauthenticated user state by rendering a "Đăng nhập để đồng bộ" button which automatically triggers the built-in `LoginModal`.
  - Added support for aborting ongoing sync processes with a safe "Hủy" (Abort) confirmation button calling `abortSync()`.
  - Preserved 100% backward compatibility for other components and regression test suites by configuring new properties as optional with robust fallback values.

## [7.37.4-Stable] - 2026-07-12
### Fixed
- **Real-time Voice Interaction & Mic Echo Suppression**:
  - Replaced the deprecated `ScriptProcessorNode` in `useVoiceInteraction.ts` with a modern, low-latency, and high-performance `AudioWorkletNode` by implementing and registering `/audio-processor-worklet.js`.
  - Removed direct loopback connection (`processor.connect(audioCtx.destination)`) to fully suppress hardware microphone feedback and whistling rumbles, particularly on Android and mobile devices. Connected the worklet through a silent `GainNode` (gain = 0) to ensure background execution thread scheduling remains active in all browser sandboxes.
  - Implemented high-fidelity client-side linear interpolation resampling down to exactly 16000Hz before transmitting raw audio data, bypassing non-compliant hardware sample rates on Android.
  - Added specific path-based WebSocket upgrade interception at `/ws/voice` on the Express backend, resolving previous connection hijacking.
  - Improved UX with explicit Vietnamese error reporting when microphone hardware access/permission is blocked or when connection timeouts occur (8s wait limit).

## [7.37.3-Stable] - 2026-07-11
### Added
- **Interactive News Templates**:
  - Implemented full functionality for "Thư viện Đối tượng => Mẫu bản tin (Templates)".
  - Templates (Morning Brief, Commute Companion, Evening Digest) now correctly configure the `preferences` (tone, duration, custom instructions) and `newsContent` when selected.
  - Selecting a template automatically navigates the user to the Mission Studio Draft sub-tab with the template's context loaded.
  - Enhanced template cards with hover effects and integrated action buttons.

## [7.37.2-Stable] - 2026-07-11
### Added
- **Mission Ready Interactive Playback Preview**:
  - Transformed the static Mic icon in "4. Hoàn tất & Xuất bản" (Publish) step of Mission Studio into an interactive, premium playback button.
  - Wired the button to the `onPlayBriefing` prop to play the newly generated briefing.
  - Implemented dynamic icon state changes (displays `Pause` icon with an elegant outer pulse wave during playback, and the standard `Mic` icon on hover/idle states).
  - Passed necessary props (`savedBriefings`, `onPlayBriefing`, `isPlayerPlaying`) from `App.tsx` down to `<MissionTabView />`.

### Verification
- Both `npm run lint` and `npm run build` pass successfully with zero warnings.

## [7.37.1-Stable] - 2026-07-11
### Fixed
- **Voice Preview Container Wrapping & Decoupling Robustness**:
  - Implemented the `wrapAsWavIfRawPcm` backend helper in `tts.routes.ts` to automatically detect raw 16-bit PCM buffer output from Gemini and wrap it inside a standard WAV (RIFF) container before streaming, while fully preserving native MP3 structures from Edge and Google Translate TTS providers.
  - Resolved silent playback failures in `/api/tts/preview` and `/api/test-tts` by ensuring the binary data starts with the standard `"UklGR"` Base64 signature for WAV formats.
  - Implemented `audio.onerror` event handlers inside `MissionTabView.tsx` and `ManualPcmPlayer.tsx` to handle asynchronous decoding failures robustly.
- **Studio Background Music Suspended State Fix**:
  - Resolved a silent-playback bug where previewing background music (Ambient, News, Electronic, Lo-Fi) would fail due to the `AudioContext` being initialized in a `"suspended"` state (common inside nested iframe sandbox environments).
  - Implemented an async `ctx.resume()` step on the AudioContext before scheduling any sound synthesis events inside `PreviewMusicSynth.start()`.
  - Deferred note scheduling and interval creation until the resume promise resolves successfully to guarantee no initial notes are lost during transition.
- **Backend Headers Timeout / Undici Fetch Safety**:
  - Implemented a general-purpose, robust `fetchWithTimeout` helper inside `src/server/shared.ts` using `AbortController` and `setTimeout` to safely abort hanging external network connections.
  - Resolved `[Symbol(undici.error.UND_ERR_HEADERS_TIMEOUT)]` errors by refactoring the RSS fetch retry loop inside `src/server/routes/news.routes.ts` to instantiate a fresh `AbortController` per attempt instead of reusing a single aborted signal across subsequent attempts.
  - Applied the `fetchWithTimeout` helper to the optional `wttr.in` weather API call in `server.ts` (with a rapid 4-second timeout) and the Google Translate TTS call in `tts.routes.ts` (with a 6-second timeout) to ensure slow upstream services can never stall the Node.js event loop.
  - Wrapped Groq Chat Completion requests in `shared.ts` with a 15-second `fetchWithTimeout` ceiling to guarantee rapid failures over prolonged API hangs.
- **Supabase Client Initialization Defense**:
  - Added a defensive fetch retry mechanism with exponential backoff for the `/api/db-config` endpoint inside `getSupabaseClientAsync` in `src/services/supabaseClient.ts`.
  - Gracefully handles transient network/startup lag where the frontend iframe requests the configuration before the backend Express app completes its boot process, eliminating red `Failed to fetch` console exceptions.

### Verification
- Both `npm run lint` and `npm run build` pass successfully with zero warnings.

## [7.37.0-Stable] - 2026-07-11
### Added
- **Two-Step Decoupled Pipeline (Sprint STU-112)**:
  - Decoupled the script generation from the voice synthesis inside the Mission Studio view.
  - Configured Stage 1 (Source Tab) to trigger only `handleGenerateScript` (which generates and saves the draft) and then navigates to Stage 2 (Draft Editor), instead of triggering the entire pipeline.
  - Wired Stage 3 (Voice Tab) to execute `handleGenerateAudio` on demand, synthesising high-fidelity voice tracks over the user's customized and saved script.
  - Integrated a persistent "Next" / "Tiếp theo" transition button in Stage 2 (Draft Editor) to allow manual navigation to Stage 3 after editorial adjustments are completed.
  - Refactored the `ProgressiveFeedback` loading screen to display steps specialized for the active processing state (Stage 2: Script creation; Stage 3: Audio rendering).
  - Maintained complete backward compatibility of the single-step `handleGenerateBriefing` method for RSS-based automation and background schedulers.

### Verification
- Full TypeScript compiler (`npm run build`) and linter checks pass successfully with zero warnings.

## [7.36.2-Recovery] - 2026-07-11
### Fixed

  - Added full stage-by-stage executors in `useBriefingGeneration.ts` (`executeStage1`, `executeStage2`, `executeStage3`, `executeStage4`) with independent loading, error, and success tracking.
  - Removed all direct UI couplings from the pipeline layers; Stage 3 now processes only the `EditorialDraft` output from Stage 2.
  - Maintained full backward compatibility with existing UI rendering states (`activePayload`, `activeTitle`, etc.) so that all parts of the application function perfectly.

## [7.34.0-Stable] - 2026-07-10
### Added
- **Fault-Tolerant Parallel Voice Synthesis via Promise.allSettled**:
  - Replaced standard `Promise.all` with `Promise.allSettled` in `handleGenerateBriefing` inside `/src/hooks/useBriefingGeneration.ts`.
  - Implemented sequentially ordered result accumulation: resolved tracks have their audio chunk buffers merged into the master stream, while failed tracks are gracefully logged and recorded.
  - Added a localized complete failure fallback that triggers if all segments fail synthesis, appending user troubleshooting tips.
  - Added `synthesisWarning` state to capture and list skipped segments (e.g., "Bỏ qua 2 phân đoạn do lỗi tổng hợp: Lời chào, Chương 1...").
  - Implemented warning banner rendering in `MissionTabView.tsx` script container preview, highlighting any skipped tracks with a styled high-contrast alert box.

## [7.33.0-Stable] - 2026-07-10
### Added
- **Validation-Driven Empty Segment Filtering for Voice Synthesis**:
  - Implemented automatic validation in `prepareSynthesisTimeline` inside `/src/utils/synthesis.ts` to skip any empty introduction, outro, chapter, or co-host segment text blocks.
  - Added warnings console logs for skipped empty elements (`[Synthesis] Skipped empty segment: <label>`).
  - Added localized error throwing if the compiled script timeline is completely empty, ensuring clear and immediate troubleshooting feedback based on the user's active UI language.

  - Added a new `onBriefingCreated` prop callback inside `useBriefingGeneration.ts`.
  - Configured `App.tsx` to automatically set the newly generated briefing ID into `selectedBriefId` state as soon as a session script and audio chunks are produced and saved to offline/indexedDB.
  - Fixes the bug where `selectedBriefId` was left unassigned or stale post-generation, unlocking instant access to downstream publishing, playback, and synchronization streams in the Creation Wizard.

## [7.30.0-Stable] - 2026-07-09
### Added
- **Interactive "Save to Library" (Stage 4) Integration**:
  - Wired up the "Lưu vào thư viện" button in Stage 4 of `MissionTabView.tsx` to trigger `handlePublishPodcast` for the generated briefing ID.
  - Added a reactive loading state spinner (`Loader2`) that disables the button and displays localized "Đang lưu..." / "Saving..." text while publishing to Supabase or the Local server is in progress.
  - Automatically triggers an elegant "✓ Đã lưu thành công" / "✓ Saved Successfully" visual confirmation badge and check icon upon successful preservation, enhancing overall user feedback.

## [7.29.0-Stable] - 2026-07-09
### Added
- **Dynamic Background Music Preview Grid (Sprint STU-104)**:
  - Upgraded the background music selection grid in `MissionTabView.tsx` (Stage 3) to match the layout of the voice studio preview controls.
  - Added new `GET /api/music-preview/:type` route in `tts.routes.ts` to dynamically check and serve static audio tracks from `/public` or `/assets`.

## [7.28.0-Stable] - 2026-07-09
### Added
- **Interactive Voice Preview Interface (Sprint STU-103)**:
  - Integrated interactive play/pause controls next to each voice option inside `MissionTabView.tsx` (Stage 3).
  - Employs a robust, lazy-loaded HTMLAudioElement stream targeting the `/api/test-tts` endpoint to render real-time vocal previews of available voice profiles.
  - Features real-time state feedback with distinct loading spinner (`Loader2`) and playback states (`Play`/`Pause`).
  - Restricts concurrent preview generation via automated click/interaction guards.

## [7.27.0-Stable] - 2026-07-09

  - Displays the original, exact error message (`errorMessage`) in a clean, scrollable monospaced typography container.
  - Leveraged semantic color tokens (`colors.critical` / `var(--color-critical)`) and the `AlertCircle` warning icon.
  - Provided interactive action buttons: "Thử lại" to re-trigger briefing generation via `handleGenerateBriefing()` and "Quay lại nguồn tin" to reset focus to Stage 1 via `handleStageChange(1)`.

## [7.26.0-Stable] - 2026-07-09
### Added
- **Locked Stage Navigation (Sprint SEC-101)**:
  - Enforced sequential stage navigation within `MissionTabView.tsx` to prevent users from skipping stages before content is ready.
  - **Stage 2 Lock**: Only interactive when `step === "summarizing" || step === "synthesizing" || step === "error" || activePayload !== null`.
  - **Stage 3 Lock**: Only interactive when `activeAudioChunks.length > 0`.
  - **Stage 4 Lock**: Only interactive when `step === "ready" && activeAudioChunks.length > 0`.
  - **Visual & Assistive States**: Disabled navigation buttons now display reduced opacity (`opacity-40`), the correct helper cursor (`cursor-not-allowed`), and a hover tooltip title providing user instructions (e.g., "Hãy tạo bản tin ở Stage 1 trước").

## [7.19.0-Stable] - 2026-07-08
### Added
- **Pinnable & Hover-Expanded Responsive Sidebar (Sprint UI-102)**: Introduces tablet/narrow screen optimization for the application's main sidebar.
  - **Auto-Collapsing narrow breakpoint**: Added a responsive media threshold (width < 1280px) where the sidebar collapses by default to prevent layout fragmentation or pushing main content on narrow desktop and tablet viewports.
  - **Non-Pushing Overlay Expansion**: Developed a highly polished overlay-expansion effect. When hover or touch tap is detected on the collapsed sidebar on narrow viewports, the sidebar expands temporarily to its full width as a floating overlay (`absolute shadow-2xl z-50`), preserving the compact space allocation (`w-20`) in the main layout grid and avoiding pushing/breaking other panels.
  - **Sidebar State Pinning**: Created a "Pin" (Ghim) feature allowing users to pin the sidebar permanently open on narrow screens. Pin states are preserved automatically in `localStorage` across user sessions.
  - **Dynamic Toggle Adaptation**: Smart bottom collapse button automatically binds to pin controls when viewport is narrow, so clicking "Expand" automatically pins the sidebar open, and clicking "Collapse" unpins and closes it.
- **Token-Based Border Standardization**: Standardized borders across 17 files using a uniform theme-aware design token, resolving legacy inconsistencies.

## [7.18.0-Stable] - 2026-07-08

  - **Parked Mode Video Lock**: Added a secure toggle that only enables the full YouTube Iframe video stream when explicitly requested (intended for parked use cases), maintaining strict focus on the road.
  - **Bilingual Voice Control**: Extended the voice command engine to support switching between "Briefing" and "Entertainment" views via natural language ("Mở giải trí", "Vào YouTube", "Về bản tin").
- **Fixed**:
  - **HUD Layout Overflow**: Resolved a critical layout breakage where entertainment controls would overflow the viewport on mobile devices. Implemented strict viewport locking, `min-h-0` flex containers, and `aspect-video` constraints to ensure a 100% fixed-frame automotive interface.

## [7.17.0-Stable] - 2026-07-08
### Changed
- **Architectural Archiving & Cleanup**: Archived the dead-tree unwired v4 architecture components to `_archive/unwired-v4-architecture/` to keep the codebase pristine and prevent cognitive bloat.
  - **Archived Models**: Moved `src/types/v4` (including article, briefing, cancellation, telemetry, and DTO models) to `_archive/unwired-v4-architecture/src/types/v4/`.
  - **Pruned Unwired Modules**: Confirmed prior deletion/archiving of experimental unused `src/domain/`, `src/application/`, and corresponding mock tests.

  - **Speech Control Engine**: Integrated native Web Speech API recognition directly within `DrivingMode` supporting English and Vietnamese voice commands ("Phát", "Tạm dừng", "Bài tiếp theo", "Tua nhanh", "Tua lại", "Thoát"). Added a togglable *Continuous Hands-Free Assistant* mode and pulsing mic wave overlays with real-time transcript feedback.
  - **Tactile Audio Ducking & Gains**: Integrated automated Audio Ducking. Lowering podcast/narration volume smoothly to `15%` and background music to `1%` during voice assistant listening and feedback tone synth playback, automatically restoring volume afterwards.
  - **Intelligent Accent-Tolerant Regex**: Deployed smart, dialect-aware Regex command matchers that handle regional accents and colloquial phrases (e.g., "chạy tiếp", "mở nhạc", "phát tiếp", "dừng giùm cái", "qua bài đi", "tua tiếp").
  - **Robust Service Worker Offline Strategy**: Enhanced `/public/sw.js` dynamic caching parameters to support caching of `cors` and `opaque` static resources (Google Fonts, styling, icons). This guarantees assets are fully loaded and functioning in disconnected states.
  - **Sound Synthesizer Feedback**: Built an offline-first frequency synthesizer using the Web Audio API to play high-fidelity acoustic responses confirming hands-free actions.
  - **Offline Resilience Banner**: Added reactive window network event listeners to detect connection drops and display warning bars advising offline operations.

- **Coverage Expansion (High Risk Modules)**: Implemented 100% PASS unit tests for high-risk core services:
  - `tests/rssService.test.ts`: Covers category detection, Jaccard similarity, duplicate marking, and network/parse error fallbacks.
  - `tests/preferenceService.test.ts`: Secures interaction decay scoring and preference calculation logic using `fake-indexeddb`.
  - `tests/useSync.test.ts`: Validates `useSync` hook state transitions, offline detection, and abort logic under `jsdom` environment.
- **DoD Automated Verification (Prompt #3)**: Added mandatory `grep` verification steps to `ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md` to prevent "imaginary" file paths in documentation.

### Changed
- **Test Coverage Audit**: Completed a comprehensive audit and expansion of `src/hooks` and `src/services`.

- **Text Normalization Hardening (Prompt #4)**: Identified and fixed a regression risk in `normalizeText()` where greedy HTML stripping regex was eating mathematical comparison operators (e.g., `<5%`). Improved the regex to be surgical (tag-aware) and added regression tests in `tests/text.test.ts`.
- **Architecture Synchronization**: Updated `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` to reflect the literal `ExecutionState` names (`fetching_sources`, `normalizing_content`, etc.) verified by grep.
  ```bash
  $ grep -rnE "fetching_sources|normalizing_content|building_queue|synthesizing_audio|ready_to_play" docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
  74:[idle] ──> [initializing] ──> [fetching_sources] ──> [normalizing_content] ──> [building_queue] ──> [synthesizing_audio] ──> [ready_to_play]
  84:*   `fetching_sources`: Active retrieval from RSS feeds or local assets.
  85:*   `normalizing_content`: Text cleaning via `normalizeText` utility.
  87:*   `building_queue`: Narrative construction and script finalization via `/api/summarize`.
  88:*   `synthesizing_audio`: Parallel Text-to-Speech vocal compilation via `/api/tts`.
  90:*   `ready_to_play`: Briefing finalized and loaded into the player.
  ```

## [7.13.0-Beta] - 2026-07-07
### Changed
- **Architectural Cleanup (Prompt #3)**: Made a definitive choice on the duplicated "News Intelligence Core" architecture (Flow B) and removed the unused complex architecture (`RuntimeOrchestrator`, etc.) to `_archive_unused_architecture`. The application now exclusively relies on the active, tested React-driven generation flow.
  - **(a) Unit Tests**: Passed existing unit test suites for the active flow (e.g. `tests/synthesis.test.ts`), added a new QualityGate utility test, and implemented a robust test suite for the high-risk offline storage layer (`tests/offlineStorage.test.ts`).
  - **(b) UI Integration Test**: Verified by the end-to-end integration test in `tests/integration/RealBriefingFlow.test.tsx` which successfully mounts and executes the flow.
  - **(c) UI Evidence**: The active React-driven generation flow is explicitly integrated and called in `src/App.tsx`.
    ```bash
    $ grep -rn "useBriefingGeneration" src/App.tsx
    62:import { useBriefingGeneration } from "./hooks/useBriefingGeneration";
    232:  // --- 5. Custom Audio Briefing Engine (useBriefingGeneration) ---

  - `NormalizeStep`: Sanitizes content by removing HTML markup, collapsing excess whitespace, and stripping URL tracking elements (`utm_*`, etc.) via `ContentNormalizer`.
  - `FingerprintStep`: Generates a deterministic SHA-256 content hash using `RSSFingerprintService` to guarantee order-independence.
  - `DuplicateCheckStep`: Integrates with `FingerprintRepository` to detect duplicates, gracefully skipping downstream execution to prevent redundant LLM summarization.
  - `SummarizeStep`: Calls the `Summarizer` port to transform articles into a structured, bilingual briefing outline.

## [3.2.16-RC] - 2026-07-03

### Added
- **Broadcast Formatter**: Implemented a `cleanBroadcastArtifacts` layer before language detection to aggressively strip out common RSS artifacts (e.g., "(Reuters) -", "Breaking:", "LIVE", "Updated", "Photo:", "Video:", "Read more") for a true radio-broadcast quality reading experience.
- **Acronym & Abbreviation Normalization**: Implemented a comprehensive acronym lookup (`ACRONYM_MAP_VI`) allowing terms like "NASA", "GDP", "CEO", "TP.HCM" to be accurately spelled out in phonetics prior to synthesis.
- **Language Confidence Scoring**: Refactored the `detectLanguage` heuristic to return a confidence score (`detectLanguageWithConfidence`). Text chunks failing to meet a threshold (e.g. < 50%) now seamlessly inherit context from the preceding segment instead of hard-failing to an incorrect language.
- **Decoupled Proper Noun Dictionaries**: Extracted hardcoded proper nouns and acronym mappings into a dedicated `src/utils/tts-dictionaries.ts` configuration file to allow for independent future updates and granular classifications.
- **Proper Noun Dictionary**: Excluded standard proper nouns like Google, OpenAI, Gemini, ChatGPT, Apple, World Cup, Premier League, etc. during language detection to prevent false-positive language shifts for bilingual sentences.
- **Linguistic Text Normalization**: Structured a normalization engine (`normalizeTextForLanguage`) to automatically translate numbers, percentages, units (km, kg, USD), and common symbols (`vs`, `&`, `@`) into their proper spoken equivalents depending on the target language block (Vietnamese vs. English) before synthesis.
- **Smart Slash Boundaries (`/`)**: Added a fraction, date, and abbreviation-aware delimiter parser that preserves entries like `2026/07/03` or `and/or` while successfully dividing true translation pair sentences.
- **Neutral Token Inheritance**: Enabled numeric or symbolic segments (with no alphabetical letters) to automatically inherit the surrounding block language instead of resorting to static defaults.
- **Multi-block Audio Delivery**: Refactored the TTS response to return an array of independent base64 audio chunks (`audioChunks[]`). This prevents container corruption caused by concatenating different formats (MP3/WAV) on the server, ensuring clean native decoding at the client.
- **Header-Based Client Routing**: Optimized `ManualPcmPlayer` to identify container types (WAV/MP3/PCM) via binary headers before decoding, eliminating expected `EncodingError` logs and streamlining the playback pipeline.
- **Unified TTS & Player Audit Layer**: Integrated a comprehensive logging system (`[TTS-AUDIT]` and `[ManualPcmPlayer-AUDIT]`) that tracks engine performance, container headers, chunk sizes, and decoding paths (Native vs. PCM Fallback) to provide verifiable evidence for field testing.

## [3.2.15-RC] - 2026-07-03

### Added
- **Language-Aware Text Segmentation**: Introduced an in-depth, language-aware paragraph & sentence-level text segmenter at the `/api/tts` level to detect Vietnamese vs. English sentences and group them into ordered single-language blocks.
- **Language-Specific TTS Routing**: Configured the synthesis engine to only send pure single-language blocks to their designated speech synthesis engines (Edge TTS for Vietnamese, Gemini TTS for English), entirely avoiding mixed-language mispronunciation errors (e.g. Vietnamese voice trying to read English phonetically).
- **Silent Skip in VN_ONLY Mode**: Added a dynamic skip fallback for bilingual news tracks when in "Vietnamese Only" playback mode, seamlessly filtering out any English sentences and delivering a clean, uninterrupted Vietnamese broadcast experience.
- **Selective Gemini Cooldown**: Updated the Gemini engine transient timeout recovery lockouts to ignore configuration, authorization, or bad request errors (400, 401, 403, 404), ensuring we do not apply a lockout penalty for static structural issues.

## [3.2.14-RC] - 2026-07-03

### Fixed
- **Audio Quality (Boundary Pops/Static)**: Applied a 5ms linear fade-in and a 10ms linear fade-out to all decoded audio buffers in memory inside `ManualPcmPlayer.tsx` before joining. This prevents clicks, pops, and static at sentence boundaries.
- **RSS Manager Filter UX**: Replaced blocked browser alert popups inside the AI Studio iframe sandbox with an interactive, beautiful non-blocking inline warning and confirmation panel. It offers helpful tips when 0 articles are found and allows confirmation to generate briefings with fewer articles when available.
- **Aggressive Gemini TTS Lockout**: Reduced the global Gemini engine disable lockout from 3 minutes to 10 seconds. This prevents transient chunk-level timeouts from disabling the primary high-quality TTS engine for subsequent request chunks.

## [3.2.13-RC] - 2026-07-03

### Fixed
- **Supabase Client Initialization**: Gracefully handle AI Studio sandbox/iframe cookie checks redirection when accessing `/api/db-config`. If the browser receives an HTML page, it falls back gracefully to `LOCAL_ONLY` instead of throwing a JSON parsing error (`Unexpected token '<'`).
